    <h1><strong>Food for a family</strong></h1>
    <h7><p>First, we want to make sure that every family has food. In current flood crisis in Sylhet, it is abundantly obvious that people prioritize food over all other needs. People have been going without food and a way to cook for many days, which has caused them to be hungry. Therefore, it is our first priority to provide food for as many family members as possible using the gift money.</p></h7>

    <h1><strong>Shelter for a family</strong></h1>
    <h7><p>Many families have lost their homes as a result of this catastrophe. They currently lack a place to live. They sought refuge in classrooms or hurricane shelters. Making dwellings for them is our second priority in order to provide them with a permanent place to reside.</p></h7>

    <h7><p >After this catastrophe, it makes perfect sense why so many young kids will leave school due to their poverty. This does not bode well for the county's future. We also want to invest the contribution funds in the educational system to safeguard their future.</p></h7>
